Just building across disciplines rather than staying within a single domain.

Works on whatever is needed — backend, design, and everything in between.
Defines required data, data models, state flow, and long-term alignment between layers before implementation.

Treats AI as a thinking and working partner,
with a focus on defining and delivering instructions clearly
so that human structure and intent can be implemented as accurately as possible.

Currently building the following products:
- _[Poketto](https://pokettoo.vercel.app)_ — Fast and minimal service for collecting, saving, and revisiting links you care about.
- _Poketto Chrome Extension_ — A Chrome extension that works seamlessly with Poketto (currently building...)
- _[Utsuwa](https://utsuwaa.vercel.app)_ - Unique personal page by arranging your links, words, and images as simple blocks.
